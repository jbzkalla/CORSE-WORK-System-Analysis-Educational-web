                        <h1>"A QUALITY FOUNDED INSTITUTION IN THE  HEART OF UGANDA".</h1>
                        <h2 id="home">The institution was founded in 1997 by the Dr.professor <br>
                        Kato Joseph Bwanika. It was the best institution ever known in the heart <br>
                        of Uganda known for the best employees produced between 1999-2010. Its original name was <br>
                        "Twins royal institute" but later it changed to the current name as a clue to the devised <br>
                        changes for administrative modification. Today, it is still considered among the top 5 great Ugandan institutions.<br>
                        By 2012, it had contributed around 700 employees in the job market and as per now many more are being produced. <br>
                        The institution has gone under a re-innovation process since most of the infrastructures are aged.<br>
                        And as we talk now, Kalla International University has one of the best infrastuctures around town<br>
                        and this is the Charles Mukasa Library. </h2>
